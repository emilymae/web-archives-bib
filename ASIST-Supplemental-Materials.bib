Nevertheless, we do not have the right tools to aggregate and preserve blog content correctly, as well as to manage blog archives effectively. Given the rising importance of blogs, it is crucial to build systems to facilitate blog preservation, safeguarding an essential part of our heritage that will prove valuable for current and future generations. In this paper, we present our work in progress towards building a novel blog preservation platform featuring robust digital preservation, management and dissemination facilities for blogs. This work is part of the BlogForever project which is aiming to make an impact to the theory and practice of blog preservation by creating guidelines and software that any individual or organization could use to preserve their blogs.},

  abstract = {Use of computational methods for exploration and analysis of web archives sources is emerging in new disciplines such as digital humanities. This raises urgent questions about how such research projects process web archival material using computational methods to construct their findings. This paper aims to enable web archives scholars to document their practices systematically to improve the transparency of their methods. We adopt the Research Object framework to characterize three case studies that use computational methods to analyze web archives within digital history research. We then discuss how the framework can support the characterization of research methods and serve as a basis for discussions of methods and issues such as reuse and provenance. The results suggest that the framework provides an effective conceptual perspective to describe and analyze the computational methods used in web archive research on a high level and make transparent the choices made in the process. The documentation of the research process contributes to a better understanding of the findings and their provenance, and the possible reuse of data, methods, and workflows.},

From early browsers to today?s principal source of information, entertainment and much else, the Web is an integral part of our daily lives, to the extent that some people believe ?if it?s not online, it doesn?t exist?. While this statement is not entirely true, it is becoming increasingly accurate, and reflects the Web?s role as an indispensable treasure trove. It is curious, therefore, that historians and social scientists have thus far made little use of the Web to investigate historical patterns of culture and society, despite making good use of letters, novels, newspapers, radio and television programmes, and other pre-digital artefacts. This volume argues that now is the time to question what we have learnt from the Web so far. The 12 chapters explore this topic from a number of interdisciplinary angles ? through histories of national web spaces and case studies of different government and media domains.},

  abstract = {This article examines the tools, approaches, collaboration, and findings of the Web Archives for Historical Research Group around the capture and analysis of about 4 million tweets during the 2015 Canadian Federal Election. We hope that national libraries and other heritage institutions will find our model useful as they consider how to capture, preserve, and analyze ongoing events using Twitter., While Twitter is not a representative sample of broader society \textendash{} Pew research shows in their study of US users that it skews young, college-educated, and affluent (above \$50,000 household income) \textendash{} Twitter still represents an exponential increase in the amount of information generated, retained, and preserved from 'everyday' people. Therefore, when historians study the 2015 federal election, Twitter will be a prime source., On August 3, 2015, the team initiated both a Search API and Stream API collection with twarc, a tool developed by Ed Summers, using the hashtag \#elxn42. The hashtag referred to the election being Canada's 42nd general federal election (hence 'election 42' or elxn42). Data collection ceased on November 5, 2015, the day after Justin Trudeau was sworn in as the 42nd Prime Minister of Canada. We collected for a total of 102 days, 13 hours and 50 minutes., To analyze the data set, we took advantage of a number of command line tools, utilities that are available within twarc, twarc-report, and jq. In accordance with the Twitter Developer Agreement \& Policy, and after ethical deliberations discussed below, we made the tweet IDs and other derivative data available in a data repository. This allows other people to use our dataset, cite our dataset, and enhance their own research projects by drawing on \#elxn42 tweets., Our analytics included:, Our article introduces our collecting work, ethical considerations, the analysis we have done, and provides a framework for other collecting institutions to do similar work with our off-the-shelf open-source tools. We conclude by ruminating about connecting Twitter archiving with a broader web archiving strategy.},

These playbacks could be construed as ``website histories'', distinctive at least in principle from other uses put to the Internet Archive such as ``digital history'' and ``Internet history''. In the following, common use cases for web archives are put forward in a discussion of digital source criticism. Thereafter, I situate website history within traditions in web historiography. The particular approach to website history introduced here is called ``screencast documentaries''. Building upon Jon Udell's pioneering screencapturing work retelling the edit history of a Wikipedia page, I discuss overarching strategies for narrating screencast documentaries of websites, namely histories of the Web as seen through the changes to a single page, media histories as negotiations between new and old media as well as digital histories made from scrutinising changes to the list of priorities at a tone-setting institution such as whitehouse.gov.},

It reviews previous attempts to use web archives to understand national web domains and describes the dataset. Next, it presents an analysis of the .uk domain, including the overall number of links in the archive and changes in the link density of different second-level domains over time. We then explore changes over time within a particular second-level domain, the academic subdomain .ac.uk, and compare linking practices with variables, including institutional affiliation, league table ranking, and geographic location. We do not detect institutional affiliation affecting linking practices and find only partial evidence of league table ranking affecting network centrality, but find a clear inverse relationship between the density of links and the geographical distance between universities. This echoes prior findings regarding offline academic activity, which allows us to argue that real-world factors like geography continue to shape academic relationships even in the Internet age. We conclude with directions for future uses of web archive resources in this emerging area of research.},

  doi = {10.1109/JCDL.2014.6970187},
  abstract = {Web archives do not capture every resource on every page that they attempt to archive. This results in archived pages missing a portion of their embedded resources. These embedded resources have varying historic, utility, and importance values. The proportion of missing embedded resources does not provide an accurate measure of their impact on the Web page; some embedded resources are more important to the utility of a page than others. We propose a method to measure the relative value of embedded resources and assign a damage rating to archived pages as a way to evaluate archival success. In this paper, we show that Web users' perceptions of damage are not accurately estimated by the proportion of missing embedded resources. The proportion of missing embedded resources is a less accurate estimate of resource damage than a random selection. We propose a damage rating algorithm that provides closer alignment to Web user perception, providing an overall improved agreement with users on memento damage by 17\% and an improvement by 51\% if the mementos are not similarly damaged. We use our algorithm to measure damage in the Internet Archive, showing that it is getting better at mitigating damage over time (going from 0.16 in 1998 to 0.13 in 2013). However, we show that a greater number of important embedded resources (2.05 per memento on average) are missing over time.},

  issn = {1923-6409},
  abstract = {Since the 1990s, the Web has increasingly become the location where we carry out our activities and generate primary and secondary records. Increasingly, such records exist only on the Web, with no complementary or supplementary records available elsewhere. While web archives began to preserve this legacy in 1991, web history has not yet emerged as a fully developed field. One explanation may be historians' concerns that they will not be able to replicate their historical research process when using web archives, and may not find essential and authoritative records. The article's first section proposes a thought experiment in which a future historian in 2050 wants to research web history using web archives as they existed in 2015. She relies on the customary historical research process through which historians choose topics and search, browse, and contextualize sources in depth and iteratively. The experiment fails when our historian is unable to locate appropriate repositories and authoritative records without resorting to the live Web of 2015. The second section then analyzes 21 eminent web archives in 2015 and issues that may have an impact on historical research. Most web archives are apparently akin to libraries of information resources. Archivists and historians, however, need web repositories to contain and make accessible essential web records of enduring cultural, historical, and evidentiary value. The article suggests that historians may once again prove invaluable in figuring out basic archival issues related to web records and archives, just as they helped shape archival policies a couple of centuries ago.~R{\'E}SUM{\'E}Depuis les ann{\'e}es 1990, le web comme lieu o{\`u} nous menons nos activit{\'e}s et g{\'e}n{\'e}rons nos documents de source primaire et secondaire a pris une importance croissante. De plus en plus, de tels documents existent seulement sur le web, sans qu'aucun autre document compl{\'e}mentaire ou suppl{\'e}mentaire ne soit disponible ailleurs. Alors que les archives du web ont commenc{\'e} {\`a} conserver ce patrimoine en 1991, l'histoire du web comme discipline bien {\'e}tablie n'a pas encore vu le jour. Une explication possible pourrait {\^e}tre l'inqui{\'e}tude qu'ont les historiens qu'ils/elles ne pourront pas reproduire leur m{\'e}thode de recherche historique en se servant des archives du web, et ne pourront pas trouver les documents essentiels et qui font autorit{\'e}. La premi{\`e}re partie de l'article propose d'imaginer une historienne en 2050 qui veut chercher l'histoire du web en se servant des archives de l'Internet telles qu'elles existaient en 2015. Elle se sert de la m{\'e}thode de recherche historique habituelle {\`a} partir de laquelle les historiens choisissent un sujet et effectuent leur recherche, fur{\`e}tent et contextualisent leurs sources de fa{\c c}on it{\'e}rative et pouss{\'e}e. L'exp{\'e}rience conna{\^\i}t un {\'e}chec quand l'historienne est incapable de rep{\'e}rer les d{\'e}p{\^o}ts d'archives appropri{\'e}s et les documents qui font autorit{\'e} sans avoir recours au web tel qu'il existait en 2015. La deuxi{\`e}me partie analyse vingt-et-une archives du web en 2015 et les enjeux qui pourraient avoir un impact sur la recherche historique. La plupart des archives sur le web sont, de toute apparence, semblables aux biblioth{\`e}ques de ressources d'information. Les archivistes et les historiens, cependant, ont besoin de d{\'e}p{\^o}ts qui contiennent et qui rendent accessibles les documents essentiels du web qui ont une valeur durable culturelle, historique et de preuve. Cet article sugg{\`e}re que les historiens pourraient encore une fois {\^e}tre indispensables pour d{\'e}terminer les questions archivistiques de base li{\'e}es aux documents et archives du web, tout comme ils ont aid{\'e} {\`a} fa{\c c}onner les politiques archivistiques d'il y a quelques si{\`e}cles.},

In this paper we address the issues of enabling the collection of fresh and relevant Web and Social Web content for a topic of interest through seamless integration of Web and Social Media in a novel integrated focused crawler. The crawler collects Web and Social Media content in a single system and exploits the stream of fresh Social Media content for guiding the crawler.},

In our problem formulation, users are interested in broad topics such as politics, sports, and entertainment: our system processes tweets in real time to identify relevant, novel, and salient content. There are three interesting aspects to our work: First, instead of attempting to tame the cacophony of unfiltered tweets, we exploit a smaller, but still sizeable, collection of curated tweet streams corresponding to the Twitter accounts of different media outlets. Second, we apply distant supervision to extract topic labels from curated streams that have a specific focus, which can then be leveraged to build high-quality topic classifiers essentially "for free". Finally, our system delivers content via Twitter direct messages, supporting in situ interactions modeled after conversations with intelligent agents. These ideas are demonstrated in an end-to-end working prototype.},

Some collections are distributed by making available the ids of the tweets that comprise the collection and providing tools to fetch the actual content; this approach has scalability limitations. In other cases, evaluation organizers have set up APIs that provide access to collections for specific tasks, without exposing the underlying content. This is a workable solution, but difficult to sustain over the long term since someone has to maintain the APIs. We have noticed that the non-profit Internet Archive has been making available for public download captures of the so-called Twitter "spritzer" stream, which is the same source as the Tweets2013 collection used in the TREC 2013 and 2014 Microblog Tracks. We analyzed both datasets in terms of content overlap and retrieval baselines to show that the Internet Archive data can serve as a drop-in replacement for the Tweets2013 collection, thereby providing the research community with, finally, a downloadable collection of tweets. Beyond this finding, we also study the impact of tweet deletions over time and how they affect the test collections.},

  abstract = {Web archives preserve the fast changing Web by repeatedly crawling its content. The crawling strategy has an influence on the data that is archived. We use link anchor text of two Web crawls created with different crawling strategies in order to compare their coverage of past popular topics. One of our crawls was collected by the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) using a depth-first strategy on manually selected websites from the .nl domain, with the goal to crawl websites as completes as possible. The second crawl was collected by the Common Crawl foundation using a breadth-first strategy on the entire Web, this strategy focuses on discovering as many links as possible. The two crawls differ in their scope of coverage, while the KB dataset covers mainly the Dutch domain, the Common Crawl dataset covers websites from the entire Web. Therefore, we used three different sources to identify topics that were popular on the Web; both at the global level (entire Web) and at the national level (.nl domain): Google Trends, WikiStats, and queries collected from users of the Dutch historic newspaper archive. The two crawls are different in terms of their size, number of included websites and domains. To allow fair comparison between the two crawls, we created sub-collections from the Common Crawl dataset based on the .nl domain and the KB seeds. Using simple exact string matching between anchor texts and popular topics from the three different sources, we found that the breadth-first crawl covered more topics than the depth-first crawl. Surprisingly, this is not limited to popular topics from the entire Web but also applies to topics that were popular in the .nl domain.},

These collections constitute an increasingly important source for researchers in the social sciences, the historical sciences and journalists interested in studying past events. However, there are currently no access methods that help users to efficiently access information, in particular about specific events, beyond the retrieval of individual disconnected documents. Therefore we propose a novel method to extract event-centric document collections from large scale Web archives. This method relies on a specialized focused extraction algorithm. Our experiments on the German Web archive (covering a time period of 19 years) demonstrate that our method enables the extraction of event-centric collections for different event types.},

However, despite the increasing number of web archives worldwide, the absence of efficient and meaningful exploration methods still remains a major hurdle in the way of turning them into a usable and useful information source. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose an RDF/S model and a distributed framework for building semantic profiles ("layers") that describe semantic information about the contents of web archives. A semantic layer allows describing metadata information about the archived documents, annotating them with useful semantic information (like entities, concepts and events), and publishing all this data on the Web as Linked Data. Such structured repositories offer advanced query and integration capabilities and make web archives directly exploitable by other systems and tools. To demonstrate their query capabilities, we build and query semantic layers for three different types of web archives. An experimental evaluation showed that a semantic layer can answer information needs that existing keyword-based systems are not able to sufficiently satisfy.},

  shorttitle = {{The Web as a Historical Corpus}},
  abstract = {The goal of this thesis is to understand the impact that the transition from analogue to born-digital sources will have on the way historians collect, analyse and select primary evidences. This thesis aims in particular at addressing the simultaneous scarcity and abundance of digital materials and at dealing with these issues by combining the historical method with methodologies from the fields of internet studies and natural language processing. The case study of this work is focused on recollecting sources on the recent past of Italian academic institutions, with specific attention to the University of Bologna.
The dissertation is organised in three main parts. Part I offers an extensive overview of the academic background where this thesis is settled. Next, the so-called scarcity issue is addressed, by considering university websites as primary sources for the study of the recent past of academic institutions. With a combination of traditional sources and methods together with solutions from the field of internet studies, Part II presents how the digital past of the University of Bologna has been reconstructed. The collected resources allowed to address the second issue, namely the large abundance of born-digital sources. Part III focuses on collecting, analysing and selecting materials from large collections of academic publications. In particular, it is remarked on the importance of adopting methods from the field of natural language processing in a highly critical way. This point is stressed by presenting a case-study focused on identifying interdisciplinary collaborations through the analysis of a corpus of Ph.D. dissertations.
Based on the case-studies presented, the final part of the dissertation describes how this work intends to be a contribution both to the research in digital humanities and in historiography.},

  abstract = {The Web is increasingly important for all aspects of our society, culture and economy. Webarchiving is the process of gathering digital materials from the Web, ingesting it, ensuringthat these materials are preserved in an archive, and making the collected materials availablefor future use and research. Web archiving is a difficult problem due to organizational andtechnical reasons. We focus on the technical aspects of Web archiving.In this dissertation, we focus on improving the data acquisition aspect of the Web archiving process. We establish the notion of Website Archivability (WA) and we introduce theCredible Live Evaluation of Archive Readiness Plus (CLEAR+) method to measure WA forany website. We propose new algorithms to optimise Web crawling using near-duplicatedetection and webgraph cycle detection, resolving also the problem of web spider traps.Following, we suggest that different types of websites demand different Web archiving approaches. We focus on social media and more specifically on weblogs. We introduce weblogarchiving as a special type of Web archiving and present our findings and developments inthis area: a technical survey of the blogosphere, a scalable approach to harvest modern weblogs and an integrated approach to preserve weblogs using a digital repository system.},

  title = {{Information search in web archives}},
  copyright = {openAccess},
  abstract = {Web archives preserve information that was published on the web or digitized from printed publications. Many of that information is unique and historically valuable. However, users do not have dedicated tools to find the desired information, which hampers the usefulness of web archives. This dissertation investigates solutions towards the advance of web archive information retrieval (WAIR) and contributes to the increase of knowledge about its technology and users. The thesis underlying this work is that the search results can be improved by exploiting temporal information intrinsic to web archives. This temporal information was leveraged from two different angles. First, the long-term persistence of web documents was analyzed and modeled to better estimate their relevance to a query. Second, a temporal-dependent ranking framework that learns and combines ranking models specific for each period was devised. This approach contrasts with a typical single-model approach that ignores the variance of web characteristics  over time.  The proposed approach was empirically validated through various controlled experiments that demonstrated their superiority over the state-of-the-art in WAIR.},

  title = {Indexing Methods for Web Archives},
  copyright = {Standardvertrag ohne Print on Demand},
  abstract = {There have been numerous efforts recently to digitize previously published content and preserving born-digital content leading to the widespread growth of large text reposi- tories. Web archives are such continuously growing text collections which contain ver- sions of documents spanning over long time periods. Web archives present many op- portunities for historical, cultural and political analyses. Consequently there is a grow- ing need for tools which can efficiently access and search them.
In this work, we are interested in indexing methods for supporting text-search work- loads over web archives like time-travel queries and phrase queries. To this end we make the following contributions:
\textbullet{} Time-travel queries are keyword queries with a temporal predicate, e.g., ``mpii saarland'' @ [06/2009], which return versions of documents in the past. We in- troduce a novel index organization strategy, called index sharding, for efficiently supporting time-travel queries without incurring additional index-size blowup. We also propose index-maintenance approaches which scale to such continuously growing collections.
\textbullet{} We develop query-optimization techniques for time-travel queries called partition selection which maximizes recall at any given query-execution stage.
\textbullet{} We propose indexing methods to support phrase queries, e.g., ``to be or not to be that is the question''. We index multi-word sequences and devise novel query- optimization methods over the indexed sequences to efficiently answer phrase queries.
We demonstrate the superior performance of our approaches over existing methods by extensive experimentation on real-world web archives.},

I begin by noting that discursive constructions of the web as disruptive, open, and participatory have emerged at various points in the medium's history, and that these discourses are not as neatly tied to economic interests as most new media criticism would suggest. With this in mind, field theory is introduced as a potential framework for understanding this (re)production of a belief in the new as a dynamic of the interplay of cultural and symbolic forms of capital within the new media field. After discussing how Bourdieu's theory might be applied to new media culture in general terms, I turn to a key moment in the emergence of the new media field\textemdash{}the rise of cybercultural magazines Mondo 2000 and Wired in the early 1990s\textemdash{}to illustrate how Bourdieu's theory may be adapted in the study of new media history.},

  doi = {10.1177/2053951715595823},
  abstract = {This paper proposes a multimodal ethnosemiotic conceptual framework for culturally themed selective Web archiving, taking as a practical example the curation of the London French Special Collection (LFSC) in the UK Web Archive. Its focus on a particular `community' is presented as advantageous in overcoming the sheer scale of data available on the Web; yet, it is argued that these ethnographic boundaries may be flawed if they do not map onto the collective self-perception of the London French. The approach establishes several theoretical meeting points between Pierre Bourdieu's ethnography and Gunther Kress's multimodal social semiotics, notably, the foregrounding of practice and the meaning-making potentialities of the everyday; the implications of language and categorisation; the interplay between (curating/researcher) subject and (curated/research) object; evolving notions of agency, authorship and audience; together with social engagement, and the archive as dynamic process and product. The curation rationale proposed stems from Bourdieu's three-stage field analysis model, which places a strong emphasis on habitus, considered to be most accurately (re)presented through blogs, yet necessitates its contextualisation within the broader (diasporic) field(s), through institutional websites, for example, whilst advocating a reflexive awareness of the researcher/curator's (subjective) role. This, alongside the Kressian acknowledgement of the inherent multimodality of on-line resources, lends itself convincingly to selection and valuation strategies, whilst the discussion of language, genre, authorship and audience is relevant to the potential cataloguing of Web objects. By conceptualising the culturally themed selective Web-archiving process within the ethnosemiotic framework constructed, concrete recommendations emerge regarding curation, classification and crowd-sourcing.},

  abstract = {The wealth of digital information available in our time has become indispensable for a rich variety of tasks. We use data on the Web for work, leisure, and research, aided by various search systems, allowing us to find small needles in giant haystacks. Despite recent advances in personalization and contextualization, however, various types of tasks, ranging from simple lookup tasks to complex, exploratory and analytical ventures, are mainly supported in elementary, "one-size-fits-all" search interfaces. Web archives, keepers of our future cultural heritage, have gathered petabytes of valuable Web data, which characterize our times for future generations. Access to these archives, however, is surprisingly limited: online Web archives usually provide a URL-based Wayback Machine interface, sometimes extended with rudimentary search options. As a result of limited access, Web archives have not been widely used for research so far. For emerging research using Web archives, there is a need to move beyond URL-based and simple search access, towards providing support for complex (re)search tasks. In my thesis, I am exploring ways to move beyond the "one-size-fits-all" approach for search systems, and I work on systems which can support the flow of complex search, also in the context of archived Web data. Rich models of search and research can be incorporated into adaptive search systems, supporting search strategies in various stages of complex search tasks. Concretely, I look at the use case of the Humanities researcher, for which the large, Terabyte-scale Web archives can be a valuable addition to existing sources utilized to perform research.},

  doi = {10.1109/JCDL.2017.7991576},
  abstract = {The national (non-local) news media has different priorities than the local news media. If one seeks to build a collection of stories about local events, the national news media may be insufficient, with the exception of local news which "bubbles" up to the national news media. If we rely exclusively on national media, or build collections exclusively on their reports, we could be late to the important milestones which precipitate major local events, thus, run the risk of losing important stories due to link rot and content drift. Consequently, it is important to consult local sources affected by local events. Our goal is to provide a suite of tools (beginning with two) under the umbrella of the Local Memory Project (LMP) to help users and small communities discover, collect, build, archive, and share collections of stories for important local events by leveraging local news sources. The first service (Geo) returns a list of local news sources (newspaper, TV and radio stations) in order of proximity to a user-supplied zip code. The second service (Local Stories Collection Generator) discovers, collects and archives a collection of news stories about a story or event represented by a user-supplied query and zip code pair. We evaluated 20 pairs of collections, Local (generated by our system) and non-Local, by measuring archival coverage, tweet index rate, temporal range, precision, and sub-collection overlap. Our experimental results showed Local and non-Local collections with archive rates of 0.63 and 0.83, respectively, and tweet index rates of 0.59 and 0.80, respectively. Local collections produced older stories than non-Local collections, at a higher precision (relevance) of 0.84 compared to a non-Local precision of 0.72. These results indicate that Local collections are less exposed, thus less popular than their non-Local counterpart.},

However, to use them as a scholarly source, researchers require a tool that provides efficient access to Web archive data for extraction and derivation of smaller datasets. Besides efficient access we identify five other objectives based on practical researcher needs such as ease of use, extensibility and reusability. Towards these objectives we propose ArchiveSpark, a framework for efficient, distributed Web archive processing that builds a research corpus by working on existing and standardized data formats commonly held by Web archiving institutions. Performance optimizations in ArchiveSpark, facilitated by the use of a widely available metadata index, result in significant speed-ups of data processing. Our benchmarks show that ArchiveSpark is faster than alternative approaches without depending on any additional data stores while improving usability by seamlessly integrating queries and derivations with external tools.},

Grounded in theoretical debates in Science and Technology Studies about digital and algorithmic platforms as ``black boxes'', this article uses provenance information and other data traces provided by the IAWM to uncover specific epistemic processes embedded at its back-end, through a case study on the archiving of the North Korean web. In 2016, an error in the configuration of one of North Korea's name servers revealed that it contains 28 websites. However, the IAWM has snapshots of the majority of the .kp websites, which have been archived from as early as 2010. How did the IAWM accumulate knowledge about the .kp websites that are generally hidden to the world? Through our findings we argue that historical knowledge on the IAWM is generated by an entangled and iterative system comprised of proactive human contributions, routinely operated crawls and a reification of external, crowd-sourced knowledge devices. These turn the IAWM into a repository whose knowing of the past is potentially surplus \textendash{} harbouring information which was unknown to each of the contributing actors at the time and place of archiving.},

The methodology shows how an initial corpus was created and analysed to establish the purpose of the MoD and Armed Forces websites. Visual hierarchy design, thematic content analysis, and an understanding of website design were used to contextualise online content. Recruitment content is shown to have been a chief concern of the Armed Forces websites throughout the period, particularly for the British Army. Changes in recruitment terminology and the increased employment of interactive content are examined. It is argued that the greater use of content such as videos was not the result of a change in approach towards recruitment but an adoption of the increased capabilities of websites.

  abstract = {This paper outlines a collaborative project between three UK Legal Deposit Libraries, the Library of Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin, the Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford, and the British Library, to create a web archive collection of material relating to the one hundredth anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. From a curatorial perspective, it discusses the potential of themed web archive collections for researching commemorative events, outlines the evolving understanding of archival material, reviews the project, and explores the technical, legal, and methodological problems and opportunities that emerged as the project progressed. It highlights the challenges that arose from collaborating across multiple jurisdictions with differing arrangements surrounding non-print legal deposit, and the impact of institutional and legislative frameworks on collection building.},

  abstract = {This short article explores the challenges involved in demonstrating the value of web archives, and the histories that they embody, beyond media and Internet studies. Given the difficulties of working with such complex archival material, how can researchers in the humanities and social sciences more generally be persuaded to integrate Internet histories into their research? How can institutions and organisations be sufficiently convinced of the worth of their own online histories to take steps to preserve them? And how can value be demonstrated to the wider general public? It touches on public attitudes to personal and institutional Internet histories, barriers to access to web archives \textendash{} technical, legal and methodological - and the cultural factors within academia that have hindered the penetration of new ways of working with new kinds of primary source. Rather than providing answers, this article is intended to provoke discussion and dialogue between the communities for whom Internet histories can and should be of significance.},
