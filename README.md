# Web Archives Bibliography
This bibliography aims to aggregate the published literature on web archives and web archiving. The focus is on web archives programs at libraries, archives, museums and other cultural heritage institutions, tending to use large-scale methods of collection through client-side web crawling. Some recent publications are included here that address social media collections, but this has not been the focus in building this bibliography.

The bibliography consists of several overlapping parts:
* [A PDF list of recent literature](ASIST-Supplemental-Materials-Bibliography.pdf) (published between 2013 and early 2018) that serves as supplemental material to the forthcoming paper "Whatâ€™s Cached is Prologue: Reviewing Recent Web Archives Research Towards Supporting Scholarly Use" to be presented at the [2018 ASIS&T Annual Meeting](https://www.asist.org/am18/), November 10-14 2018, Vancouver, Canada. (also as a [Bibtex file](ASIST-Supplemental-Materials.bib) and [CSV file](ASIST-Supplemental-Materials.csv)) 
* [A selection of these recent publications sorted by theme](research-by-theme.md) - this includes select relevant work published prior to 2013. *This is a work in progress and I hope to keep adding to the list and developing these themes further*
* [A selection of publications sorted by venue](research-by-venue.md) includes individual publications grouped by anthology, special issue, or conference workshop.
* A [Bibtex file](web-archives-bib.bib) of 436 references on web archiving, published from 1997 to the present.

This work has developed from my work developing a literature review as part of my PhD dissertation, but I also hope that it serves as a useful resource for the web archives research community, since it can be difficult to locate publications from the broad academic disciplines and publication venues related to web archives and web archiving.
