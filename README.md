Bibliography of research on web archives and web archiving

This bibliography aims to aggregate the published literature on web archives and web archiving. The focus is on web archives programs at libraries, archives, museums and other cultural heritage institutions, tending to use large-scale methods of collection through client-side web crawling. Some recent publications are included here that address social media collections, but this has not been the focus in building this bibliography. I welcome suggestions and additions of literature that address the unique challenges for collecting social media data.

The bibliography consists of several overlapping parts:
* [A PDF list of recent literature](ASIST-Supplemental-Materials-Bibliography.pdf) (published between 2013 and early 2018) that serves as supplemental material to the forthcoming paper "Whatâ€™s Cached is Prologue: Reviewing Recent Web Archives Research Towards Supporting Scholarly Use" to be presented at the [2018 ASIS&T Annual Meeting](https://www.asist.org/am18/), November 10-14 2018, Vancouver, Canada. ([Bibtex file](ASIST-Supplemental-Materials.bib) and [CSV file](ASIST-Supplemental-Materials.csv)) 
* [A selection of these recent publications sorted by theme](research-by-theme.md) - this includes additional relevant work published prior to 2013. ([PDF document](.pdf))
* [A selection of publications sorted by venue](research-by-venue.md) includes individual publications grouped by anthology, special issue, or conference workshop. ([PDF document](.pdf))
* A complete list of 436 references [Bibtex file](web-archives-bib.bib) on web archiving, published from 1997 to the present. (also a [public zotero group](.html))
